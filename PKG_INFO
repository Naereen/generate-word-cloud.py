Description: 
        The ``ansicolortags`` module provides efficient and useful functions to use colours in a terminal application with Python 2 and 3, with a *HTML-tag* like style : ``<red>text<white>`` will print ``text`` in red.
        
        All ANSI colors code are defined with this tag-like style.
        **This point is the main interest of this module,**
        because all others modules define function to print with some colours.

        Colours
        =======
        
        Foregrounds
        -----------
        
        You can choose one of the 8 basic ANSI colours: black, red, green, yellow, blue,
        magenta, cyan, white.
        The names beginning with a *lower-script* design **foreground** colours.
        
        For example: ::
        
            from ansicolortags import printc
            printc('<reset>This is default. <red>This is red<yellow> and yellow in foreground now<reset>').
        
        Backgrounds
        -----------
        
        You can choose one of the 8 basic ANSI colours: Black, Red, Green, Yellow, Blue,
        Magenta, Cyan, White.
        The names beginning with an *upper-script* design **background** colors.
        
        For example: ::
        
        
            from ansicolortags import printc
            printc('<Default>this is default. <Blue>this have a blue background<Black> and black in background now<reset>').
        
        Other tags
        ----------
        
        The following tags are also available:
        
         - ``b``, ``B`` : to turn on and off the *bold* mode,
         - ``u``, ``U`` : to turn on and off the *underline* mode,
         - ``neg``, ``Neg`` : to turn on and off the *reverse video* mode,
         - ``blink``, ``Blink`` : to turn on and off the *blink* mode,
         - ``el`` : to erase the current line,
         - ``bell`` : to make the terminal ring.
        
        Shortcuts
        ---------
        
        Some macros are also provided, like the tags ``<ERROR>``, ``<INFO>`` or ``<WARNING>``.
        
        And also ``<warning>`` and ``<question>``, which respectively give a colored ``!`` and ``?``.
        
        The ``reset`` tag is a special tag to reinitialize all previously changed parameters.
        
        Writing to a file ?
        -------------------
        
        This is possible with the ``writec`` function. For example: ::
        
            import sys
            from ansicolortags import writec
            writec('<ERROR><u><red>The computer is going to explode!<reset>', fn=sys.stderr)
            # sys.stderr.flush()
            # this is useless : writec flush itself.
        
        Auto detection
        ==============
        Of course, the colors are disabled if the output does not support them.
        
        It works perfectly on any GNU/Linux (tested with Ubuntu 10+, Debian, Arch Linux) and Windows (with or without Cygwin),
        and should work fine one MAC OS X or on other UNIX-like.
        
        Other features
        ==============
        
        Other functions
        ---------------
        
        There is also the ``xtitle()`` function, to change the title of the terminal.
        This try to use the command-line tool ``xtitle``, and if it fails it tries to use an *ANSI code* to change the title.
        
        There is also a ``notify()`` function to display a system notification (using the command-line tool ``notify-send``).
        
        Script
        ------
        
        ``ansicolortags.py`` is also a script.
        You can have his description (or use it) directly with: ::
        
            python -m ansicolortags --help
        
        For testing
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ``ansicolortags.py`` can be used to run some tests (with the ``--test`` option).
        
        With GNU/Bash
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ``ansicolortags.py`` can be used to generate a GNU/Bash color profile
        (with the ``--generate --file color.sh`` options).
        
        `See here for this color.sh file <https://bitbucket.org/lbesson/bin/src/master/.color.sh>`_
        
        This ``sh`` file can be imported with ``$ . color.sh`` in any GNU/Bash scripts, or even in your ``~/.bashrc`` file.
